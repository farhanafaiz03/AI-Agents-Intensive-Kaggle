    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic areas where AI is making a significant impact. Here are some of the newest and most exciting developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Advanced Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **De Novo Design:** Beyond just identifying existing molecules, generative AI models are now being used to design entirely *new* molecules from scratch with specific desired properties. This includes generating molecules that are predicted to bind to a particular target, have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), and are less likely to cause toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Conditional Generation:** Researchers are increasingly able to \"condition\" AI models to generate molecules based on a set of specific criteria. This could be the desired mechanism of action, a specific protein target, or even a particular chemical scaffold.\n",
      "*   **Multi-objective Optimization:** AI is adept at simultaneously optimizing for multiple drug properties. For example, a model might be tasked with designing a molecule that is potent against a disease target, has good oral bioavailability, and is easily synthesized.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI is helping to sift through massive amounts of genomic, proteomic, and clinical data to identify previously unknown biological targets that play a crucial role in disease. This is opening up new avenues for drug development.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models can assess whether a particular biological target is \"druggable\" – meaning if it's possible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it. This helps researchers focus their efforts on the most promising targets.\n",
      "*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** By analyzing complex biological networks, AI can provide deeper insights into how diseases develop and progress, which in turn helps identify the most effective points for intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI-Powered Screening and Hit Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Virtual Screening Enhancement:** While virtual screening has been around, AI is making it far more powerful. AI models can predict binding affinities and other interactions with much higher accuracy than traditional computational methods, allowing for more efficient screening of vast chemical libraries.\n",
      "*   **Active Learning for Screening:** AI can be used to guide experimental screening processes. The AI learns from initial experimental results and directs the next set of experiments to focus on the most promising candidates, significantly reducing the number of compounds that need to be physically tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Advancements in Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AlphaFold and its Successors:** Tools like DeepMind's AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction. Knowing the 3D structure of a protein is critical for understanding its function and for designing drugs that can bind to it. Newer AI models are building on this, predicting not just static structures but also protein dynamics and interactions.\n",
      "*   **Structure-Based Drug Design:** AI leverages these predicted protein structures to design molecules that fit precisely into the active sites of disease-related proteins, blocking their function or modulating their activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Reinforcement Learning for Molecule Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Iterative Design:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is being used to \"train\" AI agents to iteratively design and optimize molecules. The agent explores different chemical modifications, receives feedback on their properties (e.g., from predictive models), and learns to make better design choices over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. AI in Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Fragments:** In FBDD, small molecular fragments are identified that bind weakly to a target. AI can then assist in designing how to link or grow these fragments into more potent drug candidates, predicting optimal combinations and modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Synthesis Prediction and Route Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Retrosynthesis\" AI:** AI is being developed to predict how to chemically synthesize a designed molecule. This \"retrosynthesis\" capability helps chemists plan practical synthesis routes, considering feasibility, cost, and yield, which is a significant bottleneck in drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many biotech and pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery, including:\n",

The focus is shifting from simply finding *a* drug to finding the *best* drug for a specific disease and patient population, with greater precision and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **AI for Target Identification and Validation**. This is a crucial area because finding the right biological target is the very first step in designing a drug. If you target the wrong pathway or protein, even the most elegantly designed drug won't be effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into how AI is transforming target identification and validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Target\" in Drug Discovery?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A biological target is typically a molecule (usually a protein or a gene) within the body that is involved in a disease process. By interacting with this target (e.g., by blocking its activity or enhancing it), a drug can potentially alter the course of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Traditional Challenges of Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly intricate and interconnected. It's often difficult to pinpoint which specific molecule is the most critical driver of a disease.\n",
      "*   **Massive Datasets:** Researchers generate vast amounts of data from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and clinical studies. Manually sifting through this data to find meaningful patterns related to disease targets is nearly impossible.\n",
      "*   **Hypothesis-Driven Research:** Traditionally, target discovery has been heavily reliant on existing biological knowledge and hypotheses, which can sometimes limit the exploration of novel or unexpected targets.\n",
      "*   **Validation is Difficult and Time-Consuming:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated through extensive experiments to confirm its role in the disease and its suitability for drug intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Uncovering Novel Targets by Analyzing Complex Data:**\n",
      "    *   **\"Omics\" Data Integration:** AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at integrating and analyzing diverse \"omics\" datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.). By looking for patterns across these different layers of biological information, AI can identify genes or proteins that are consistently altered in diseased states compared to healthy states.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Causal Relationships:** AI algorithms can go beyond mere correlation. They can help infer causal relationships, suggesting that a specific gene's altered expression or a protein's dysfunction is a *driver* of the disease, not just a symptom.\n",
      "    *   **Network Biology Analysis:** AI can map out complex biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, signaling pathways). By analyzing disruptions in these networks within disease states, AI can highlight critical nodes (proteins/genes) that, if modulated, could restore normal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n",
      "    *   **Structural Information:** As mentioned with AlphaFold, AI can predict protein structures. AI models can then analyze these structures to assess if they have binding pockets suitable for small molecules or if they are amenable to antibody-based therapies.\n",
      "    *   **Functional Domains:** AI can identify key functional domains within a protein that are crucial for its activity and that might be accessible for drug intervention.\n",
      "    *   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Historically, many disease-related proteins were considered \"undruggable\" because they lacked clear binding sites. AI is beginning to find ways to target these, for example, by using allosteric modulators or protein-degrading molecules (like PROTACs), and AI can help identify potential strategies for these.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Understanding Disease Mechanisms More Deeply:**\n",
      "    *   **Subtyping Diseases:** AI can identify distinct subtypes of diseases based on molecular profiles. This is crucial because a drug that works for one subtype might not work for another. AI can help identify targets specific to particular subtypes.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Disease Biomarkers:** AI can discover biomarkers that not only indicate the presence of a disease but also its progression or its response to treatment. These biomarkers are often linked to specific molecular targets.\n",
      "    *   **Drug Repurposing:** AI can analyze existing drug data and disease information to identify drugs that might be effective for new indications by targeting pathways related to those new diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Accelerating Validation Through In Silico Experiments:**\n",
      "    *   **Predictive Modeling:** AI can build predictive models that simulate the effect of modulating a potential target on disease pathways. This allows researchers to virtually test the impact of targeting a molecule before committing to expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritizing Targets:** Based on the predictive power of AI models, researchers can prioritize a shortlist of the most promising targets for experimental validation, saving significant resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Broader Discovery Space:** AI opens up the possibility of identifying targets that human researchers might not have considered due to the sheer complexity of the data.\n",
      "*   **Increased Success Rates:** By identifying more relevant and druggable targets, AI has the potential to increase the success rates of drug discovery programs.\n",
      "*   **Faster Identification:** AI can significantly shorten the time it takes to go from raw biological data to a validated target candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI acts as a powerful microscope and analytical engine, allowing researchers to see patterns, infer relationships, and make predictions about biological systems at a scale and speed previously unimaginable. This is fundamental to finding the right starting point for developing life-saving medicines.\n",

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
